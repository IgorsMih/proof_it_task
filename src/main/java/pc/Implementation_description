Description of Premium calculator task from Proof IT company.

The task was made by using Java 14, jUnit 4.13 with Maven, Internet, JavaGuru lessons from Java1 course,
GitHub repository.

The structure of the task is divided to four packages:
- domain, where all objects posted;
- business_logic, where is algorithm implementation,
- demo, here we can see that the structure is working,
- test - Acceptance test as was requested by Proof IT company, plus additional tests to check that
  structure is correctly working.

Demo package:
Contains six classes.
Three classes for Policy, Policy object and PolicySubObject as was described in specification.
Plus three enum classes for data types that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants.
It's PolicyObjectName, PolicyStatus and RiskType.
It allow easy to add additional variables in the future, approximately new risk type or policy status.

Business_logic:
Contains four classes.
PremiumCalculator, SubObjectPremiumCalculator, FireRiskCoefficientDetector and TheftRiskCoefficientDetector.
PremiumCalculator and SubObjectPremiumCalculator contains logic of the task.
FireRiskCoefficientDetector and TheftRiskCoefficientDetector are counting two risk coefficients
as described in the specification of the task -> Premium calculation formula.

Test is jUnit test that check the correct implementation of logic and formulas
as described in the specification of the task -> Acceptance criteria
plus two tests to cover additional options.

The task was committed to my repository on GitHub.
